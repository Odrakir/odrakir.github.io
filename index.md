##Under Construction
I've been a developer for more than thirteen years now. I've worked for big brands in advertisement agencies, small clients by my self and all possible combinations in between. I have a strong front end background and I’m very interested in developing rich user interactions. I was a Flash developer for some time (I was young and I needed the money) but for the last 4 years I am focusing only on iOS development.

Oh! and I have 5 years of Swift experience… (just kidding, nobody does)

Soon you will see my work here.
